Okay, I spent some time researching DSA and here's some more information for
you. A complete DSA key is made up of 5 values: `p`, `q`, `g`, `x`, and `y`.
`p`, `q`, `g`, and `y` are all public values. The `/public_key` endpoint on the
server gives these values and can be used to verify that a given signature is
valid. The private value, x, is what we need to unlock the funds at my bank.
A DSA signature is normally computed as follows:

* First pick a `k` where 0 < `k` < `q`
* Compute the value `r` via `pow(g, k, p) % q`. This is called modular
  exponentiation and is necessary for extremely large numbers. NaÃ¯vely
  attempting to compute `g ** k % p` will be very slow.
* Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `k` modulo `q`. That is,
  `kinv` such that `(k * kinv) % q = 1`
* Compute the hash of the message you want to sign. Based on what you told me
  they're using SHA1 and converting it into an integer assuming big endian byte
  order. `int.from_bytes(hashlib.sha1(data).digest(), 'big')` (Python 3
  required!) will do this.
* Finally, calculate `s` using `kinv * (h + r * x) % q`

From what you've told me, the [main.py](https://github.com/reaperhulk/dsa-ctf/blob/master/main.py#L42)
in the secure signer code base may already have a signature implementation?
Take a look !

To confirm that `r` and `s` are correct you can also perform a DSA verification.

* Compute `w`, the modular inverse of `s` modulo `q`
* Calculate `u1 = (h * w) % q`
* Calculate `u2 = (r * w) % q`
* Calculate `v`, defined as `((g ** u1) * (y ** u2)) % p % q`. This will need to be done via modular exponentiation!

At this point `v` should be equal to `r`.

With a working DSA implementation, now we can look more closely at recovering
the private key.  Is there some way to solve for `x` given
`s = (kinv * (h + r * x)) % q`? That might be worth looking into.
