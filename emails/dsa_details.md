Okay, I spent some time researching DSA and here's some more information for
you. A complete DSA key is made up of 5 values: `p`, `q`, `g`, `x`, and `y`.
`p`, `q`, `g`, and `y` are all public values. The `/public_key` endpoint on the
server gives these values and can be used to verify that a given signature is
valid. The private value, x, is what we need to unlock the funds at my bank.
A DSA signature is normally computed as follows:

* First pick a `k` where 0 < `k` < `q`
* Compute the value `r` via `pow(g, k, p) % q`. This is called modular
  exponentiation and is necessary for extremely large numbers. NaÃ¯vely
  attempting to compute `g ** k % p` will be very slow.
* Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `k` modulo `q`. That is,
  `kinv` such that `(k * kinv) % q = 1`
* Compute the hash of the message you want to sign. Based on what you told me
  they're using SHA1 and converting it into an integer assuming big endian byte
  order. `int.from_bytes(hashlib.sha1(data).digest(), 'big')` will do this.
* Finally, calculate `s` using `kinv * (h + r * x) % q`

Using that last equation we can use modular arithmetic to solve for x.

* `s = kinv * (h + r * x) % q`
* `s * k = (h + r * x) % q`
* `rinv * ((s * k) - h) % q = x`

`rinv` is calculated just like `kinv` above. So since we know every value with
the exception of `k` all we need to learn is `k` to obtain `x`!

Once we have `x` we can confirm it's correct by computing `g**x % p`. The
result should be equal to `y`. Remember that you'll want to do that via
modular exponentiation!

Why don't you look at the source code to see how they derive `k` for signatures?
It must be predictable in some fashion. Email me if you're having trouble!
