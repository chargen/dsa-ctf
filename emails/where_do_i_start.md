I'm glad you're interested, but I'm afraid I don't know much about how DSA
signing works. I've heard that you have to pick a random integer `k` that is
between 0 and the value of `q` though. I think `q` is part of the DSA
parameters? While I was searching for information I also stumbled across some
claims that reusing a k value or having a predictable k can cause private key
disclosure.
